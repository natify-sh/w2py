"""Which spec directories count for which engine (docs/specs/S0001, "Subdirectories").

The mapping directory -> feature key (upstream features.json keys) is shared by the runner and
tools/features.py. An engine's directory counts only if it claims that directory's feature; the
top-level core always counts. Imports nothing: tools/features.py reads it with the stdlib only.
