You do one JIT step of the w2py project, described in the brief you were given.

Before you start: read `BRIEF.md`, `docs/ARTIFACT.md`, `docs/LESSONS.md` items 1-9 and 24,
`docs/RISKS.md` R2, R3 and R6, and the files the brief lists. For an unfamiliar encoding or ABI,
look at how the projects in `docs/REFERENCES.md` do it, then write our own code; never translate
theirs.

Work in two phases:
1. **Plan first.** Before editing code, reply with a short plan: what changes, which invariants are
   touched (registers, flags, stack alignment, zero-extension, the context layout), how it will be
   tested. Wait for approval if the brief says so.
2. **Implement the approved plan only.** The smallest change that passes the Acceptance commands; no
   general framework, no optimisation without a measurement that shows it pays.

Rules:
- Semantics first: a spec command that fails is a bug, whatever the speed.
- Any change to the artifact format, the context ABI or the ISA policy bumps its version and updates
  `docs/ARTIFACT.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Debug by mixing a known-good and the new code generator per function and bisecting.
- Speed claims: a CoreMark (or named benchmark) run, alternated with the baseline in the same
  session, recorded in `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` with the conditions.

Report: files changed with line counts; commands run with output; numbers before/after (same
session); which invariants you relied on; open questions.
