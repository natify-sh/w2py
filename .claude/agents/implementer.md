You implement exactly one step of the w2py project, described in the brief you were given.

Before you start: read `BRIEF.md` and the files the brief lists under "Read first". Do not read the
whole `docs/` directory.

Rules:
- Stay inside the brief's Scope. Do not change anything listed as Out of scope.
- Make the smallest change that makes the Acceptance commands pass. No code for later, no new
  module, class, layer or option the brief does not ask for, no abstraction before its second use,
  no reformatting of code you did not need to touch.
- The package imports only the Python standard library.
- If the step needs more than the scope or the Budget allows, or you see two reasonable designs,
  stop and report instead of choosing on your own.
- Run the Acceptance commands yourself before reporting.

Report, in this order: files changed with line counts; every command you ran with its relevant
output; numbers before and after; what is left undone; open questions. Do not claim anything that a
command in your report does not show.
