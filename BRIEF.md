# Read this first

This page is the briefing for anyone (person or agent) who starts work on this repository. Everything
else under `docs/` is reference material: read it when a task needs it, not before.

## What this project is, in one paragraph

**A WebAssembly compiler written in pure Python that makes fast machine code at run time, with no
native dependency.** Python can map executable memory (`mmap`) and call into it (`ctypes`), so a
compiler written in Python can emit x86-64 (later AArch64, RISC-V, …) bytes for a wasm module and run
them at native speed. The proof of concept already runs CoreMark at **86 % of Wasmtime/Cranelift with
explicit bounds checks and ~91 % with guard pages**, from a `pip install` that contains only `.py`
files. Where machine code is not allowed or no backend exists yet, the same front end translates wasm
to Python source (`pyc`), or to MicroPython code (`mpy`). Around the compiler sits a **thin runtime**
(memories, tables, instances, traps, host calls, WASI) — necessary, but not the point.

## Why it exists (the gap it fills)

| option | speed | what it costs the user |
|---|---|---|
| Wasmtime (wasmtime-py) | 100 % | a 30 MB native library per platform |
| wasm2c + a C build (natify-sh/wasmext) | ~95 % of native | a C toolchain and a build **per module per platform** |
| WAMR AOT | ~120 % | `wamrc` (LLVM) per module per platform, a native runtime, `.aot` tied to the WAMR version; modules cannot share memories or tables |
| wasm3 | ~13 % | a native extension |
| pywasm (pure-Python interpreter) | ~0.003 % | nothing |
| **this project** | **86–91 %** (JIT), ~0.8 % (`pyc` on CPython) | **nothing**: standard library only |

Measured numbers and conditions: `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`. The niche: run wasm from Python fast,
anywhere Python runs, without anyone building anything native.

## What it is NOT (read this twice)

* **Not "a reimplementation of wasmtime-py".** Wasmtime appears in the documents in two roles only:
  1. **the test oracle** — when the spec leaves room, and in differential tests, we behave as Wasmtime
     does (trap codes, NaN rules, limits);
  2. **the shape of the public Python API, later** (Engine/Store/Module/Linker/Instance), so users
     recognise it. Building that API is phase 6. **Do not start there.** API parity is not a goal by
     itself and is never worked on before the compiler and the spec tests need it.
* **Not an interpreter.** Every target translates the whole module ahead of execution (at load time).
* **Not a runtime that is embedded into generated code.** The runtime lives in the package; generated
  code is a cache artifact of it (DECISIONS.md D18).
* **Not the component model.** Components are fused into one core module beforehand (`meld fuse`).

## The architecture in five lines

```
wasm bytes -> front end (parse, validate, decode) -> HIR (trees + structured control, analyses)
   -> pyc target: Python source -> code object            (always available; the semantic reference)
   -> mpy target: MicroPython source / viper              (MicroPython)
   -> LIR (machine-neutral linear ops) -> jit-<arch>: machine code in mmap, entered through ctypes
runtime (package): memories, tables, globals, instances, traps, host calls, WASI host, cache
```

Details: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` ("The IR", "Memory", "Long calls and the GIL"), `docs/TARGETS.md`.

## What the PoC proves (and what it does not)

`poc/` is a set of scripts, not the package. It proves feasibility and gives the numbers; it covers
only what its test programs needed.

* `poc/w2py.py` — front end + `pyc` translator. Runs CoreMark on CPython (~150 it/s), PyPy (~3 000),
  MicroPython (~90); also ran **meld** (a 1.7 MB Rust program) byte-identically to Wasmtime.
* `poc/w2jit2.py` — the x86-64 JIT (pinned locals in registers, lazy value stack, fused compare+branch,
  jump tables for `br_table`, `if`/`else`): CoreMark ~16 800 it/s.
* `poc/w2jit_guard.py` — the same JIT with **guard pages**: an 8 GiB reservation plus a SIGSEGV handler
  that the JIT emits as machine code (no Python in the signal path): ~19 000 it/s.
* Compile speed of the JIT in Python: ~0.6–0.8 MB of wasm code per second (Cranelift on 2 cores is
  1.5–2.5× faster) — so a cache and, later, lazy per-function compilation matter.
* Gaps the PoC does not cover: the validator, most of the opcode set in the JIT (`call_indirect`,
  full i64, floats beyond CoreMark, bulk memory, `memory.grow`), block parameters, reference types,
  SIMD, the Wasm 3.0 features (GC, exceptions, tail calls, memory64, multi-memory, …); the runtime
  objects; WASI.

## Where to start

State on branch `phase0-skeleton` (not merged to `main`, the maintainer's choice):

* **Done, phases 0–2:** package layout, strict binary reader and validator (`src/w2py/frontend/`), the
  spec-suite runner (the metric), and the `pyc` target complete for the core group (spec core: `pyc`
  20508 pass, wasmtime oracle 20556). `pyc` is now frozen for new features and gets correctness fixes
  only; multi-memory is the first proposal after the freeze, on both targets.
* **In progress, phase 3 (`jit-x86_64`, `docs/specs/S0002` step 3):** 3a ABI, 3b integer core and 3c
  SSE2 floats with `memory.grow` are done (spec core on `jit-x86_64`: 18201 pass; CoreMark 16 299 it/s,
  PoC `w2jit2` 16 411); 3d (tables, `call_indirect`, reference types) is under way. Phase 3 already
  goes beyond the "integer core" (floats, tables) because the goal is completeness (D25).
* **Next, per `docs/ROADMAP.md`:** S0002 step 4 (fallback test), 5 (speed and ISA), 6 (review); then
  multi-memory on both targets; the second architecture (phase 4) before the opcode set is widened
  further; the public API only in phase 6.

1. **Read** this page, then `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`, then `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and the spec of the step
   in `docs/specs/`. Skip `docs/API.md` and `docs/FEATURES.md` until phase 6.
2. **Set up and check** (commands in `CLAUDE.md`, "Commands"): `uv sync`, `uv run pytest -q`,
   `uv run python tests/spec/fetch.py`, `uv run python -m tests.spec.run --engine jit-x86_64`.
3. **The metric is the spec suite** (`WebAssembly/spec` `test/core` at a pinned commit) run through a tiny
   internal engine interface, with Wasmtime behind the same interface as the oracle. The work is a loop:
   take the largest group of failures for the current target, fix it, the number grows. `pyc` is the
   semantic floor every other target must match; `tools/spec_diff.py` shows the gap between two targets.
4. **The JIT** keeps explicit bounds checks and baseline x86-64 only until phase 5 (D24, D29). The
   second architecture (aarch64 on native arm64 runners, phase 4) comes **before** the opcode set is
   widened: it is what proves the split, and the interface is frozen after it.
5. **Only then** the public runtime API in the shape of wasmtime-py, WASI (fusedwasi is the candidate
   host), the cache and serialized files (thin/fat), the CLI.
6. The PoC (`poc/`) stays runnable for comparisons (commands in `CLAUDE.md`).

Every speed claim goes into `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` with its conditions; every behaviour claim comes with
a test. "Measure, do not estimate."

## Hard rules (short form; full list in `CLAUDE.md`)

* Package imports nothing outside the standard library.
* Never crash the interpreter: bad accesses, deep recursion, host exceptions become traps/exceptions.
* One target interface, one test suite for all targets.
* The JIT artifact format and context ABI are versioned contracts (`docs/ARTIFACT.md`).
* The shared layers (front end, HIR, LIR) contain nothing Python-specific.
* Read how others did a hard thing (`docs/REFERENCES.md`: Winch, V8 Liftoff, wasm2c, TinyCC, …) and
  write our own; never translate their code.
