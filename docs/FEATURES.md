# Features

The goal is everything Wasmtime supports for core WebAssembly. The component model is the
exception: components are supported **fused** into one core module (`meld fuse`), with WASI 0.2
provided by the WASI host (to decide; fusedwasi is the candidate); nothing of `wasmtime.component` is planned.

The checklist below is generated: `python3 tools/features.py` writes `features.json` (the format of
the WebAssembly website's [features.json](https://webassembly.org/features/), pinned in
`docs/upstream/`) and the table. A feature is "yes" on a target only if its spec tests pass there;
"partial" lists the failing tests in `features.json`; "-" is not supported or its spec tests are not
run yet. Wasmtime's column is the upstream data. `pyc` is computed from `tests/spec/xfail/pyc.txt`
over the top-level `test/core` files only; `jit-x86_64` has not started. `mpy` is not listed yet.

<!-- features:end -->

**Implementation notes per proposal** (hand-written; Wasmtime's `Config.wasm_*` switch in brackets):

* multi-memory (`wasm_multi_memory`): **needed for fused components** (D7).
* memory64 (`wasm_memory64`): addresses are already Python ints in `pyc`.
* SIMD (`wasm_simd`): `pyc` v128 as an int / 16 bytes, correct first; JIT: SSE2 / NEON at the baseline (D24).
* relaxed SIMD (`wasm_relaxed_simd`, `_deterministic`): follow Wasmtime's deterministic choice when asked.
* tail calls (`wasm_tail_call`): `pyc` uses a trampoline for functions with `return_call*`; the JIT replaces the frame.
* custom page sizes (`wasm_custom_page_sizes`): a property of the `Memory` facade.
* threads (`wasm_threads`, `Config.shared_memory`): `SharedMemory`; `pyc` atomics under the GIL, care for free-threaded builds.
* exceptions (`wasm_exceptions`): `Tag`, `try_table`, `throw`, `exnref`.
* typed function references (`wasm_function_references`): `call_ref`, non-null types.
* GC (`wasm_gc`, `Config.gc_support`): structs/arrays map naturally to Python objects in `pyc`.
* wide arithmetic (`wasm_wide_arithmetic`): easy in `pyc` (big ints).
* stack switching (`wasm_stack_switching`): after everything else.
* component model: out of scope; fused core modules only (D7).


## Runtime features

| feature | Wasmtime API | plan |
|---|---|---|
| interruption of long calls | (epochs; Ctrl+C in the CLI) | JIT: interrupt word polled by the code; `pyc`: yield points (ARCHITECTURE.md, "Long calls and the GIL") |
| fuel | `Config.consume_fuel`, `Store.set_fuel/get_fuel` | counters at entries and back-edges, compiled in on demand |
| epochs | `Config.epoch_interruption`, `Engine.increment_epoch`, `Store.set_epoch_deadline` | as fuel; checked against a context slot |
| limits | `Store.set_limits` | memory/table/instance limits in the runtime |
| stack limit | `Config.max_wasm_stack` | ARCHITECTURE.md, "Calls, stack depth and recursion" |
| serialization | `Module.serialize`, `Module.deserialize(_file)` | the cache artifact format |
| cache | `Config.cache` | ARCHITECTURE.md, "Cache" |
| WASI 0.1 | `Linker.define_wasi`, `WasiConfig` | the WASI host (candidate: fusedwasi `p1` twin) |
| WASI 0.2 (fused) | `Store.set_wasi`, `set_wasi_http` | the WASI host (candidate: fusedwasi `p2` twin); needs multi-memory |
| traps with frames | `Trap.frames`, `Frame` | `pyc`: from Python tracebacks; JIT: code-address map |
| NaN semantics | canonicalization option | `pyc` loses NaN payload bits through Python floats today; decide per spec tests |

## Per-target notes

* **`mpy` (MicroPython)** supports what its interpreter allows: no `SharedMemory`/threads in general,
  big-int i64 (slow on 32-bit MCUs), floats only on ports built with them. Unsupported features are
  reported by `Target.supports`, never mis-executed.
* **JIT targets** may lag the `pyc` target feature by feature; per-module fallback keeps every module
  runnable (TARGETS.md).
