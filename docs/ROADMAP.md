# Roadmap

Phases in order; each ends with tests green for what it claims. Numbers are measured, never estimated
(BENCHMARKS.md).

## Where to start

The first goal is not a feature but a **measurement**: every later change should move a number.

1. **Skeleton** (phase 0): the repository under natify-sh with the working name `w2py` (renaming later is
   cheap); `pyproject.toml` with no runtime dependencies and a development group — `wasmtime` (the
   oracle), `pytest`, `wabt-package` (for `wast2json`); CI on CPython 3.8 and the latest, plus PyPy, on
   Linux x86-64. Minimum Python 3.8 for now (open question 1).
2. **The spec-suite runner** (phase 1, the most important step): convert `WebAssembly/spec` at a pinned
   commit with `wast2json`; a runner for the commands (`module`, `assert_return`, `assert_trap`,
   `assert_invalid`, …) over a **tiny internal engine interface** — load a module, instantiate, call an
   export, read a global — not over a wasmtime-like public API (that is phase 6).
   **Run it against wasmtime first**: this tests the runner itself, and the oracle should pass nearly
   everything.
3. **Port the PoC front end** into `frontend/` unchanged (reader and decoder from `poc/w2py.py`), connect
   the PoC's `pyc` code generator as it is, and record the **first number**: how many spec commands
   pass. The per-target expected-failures file (TESTING.md) is the task list from then on.
4. **Loop**: take the largest group of failures, fix it, watch the number grow. The validator, block
   parameters, tables, trap conversion come in the order the failures dictate.

Why this order: the spec suite plus the oracle give an objective metric from day one; `pyc` is the
simplest target and the one every other must match, so semantics are pinned there; the JIT (phases
3–5) then only reproduces checked semantics faster, and the same runner shows at once where it
deviates. The JIT comes **before** the public runtime API (phase 6): the compiler is the point, the API
only wraps it. Inside the JIT the backend interface is fixed on **two** architectures (phases 3–4)
before the opcode set is widened (phase 5): an interface proved on x86-64 alone is an x86-64 interface.
The open questions below do not block this start — the name, the WASI host and parallelism are needed
only in phases 2 and 6.

## Scope and order of the wasm features

**The target is WebAssembly Core Specification 3.0** (TESTING.md): besides 2.0 (mutable globals,
sign-extension, non-trapping float-to-int, multi-value, bulk memory, reference types, fixed-width SIMD)
it contains GC, typed function references, exception handling (`exnref`), tail calls, memory64,
multi-memory, relaxed SIMD and extended constant expressions. Not in 3.0, and so tracked as separate
proposals: threads, wide arithmetic, custom page sizes (Wasmtime Tier 2), stack switching and the
other Tier 3 ones.

The order below is **staging, not scope**: it follows what the modules that exist in practice need
(what clang, rustc and zig emit by default comes first) and what fused WASI 0.2 needs. Everything in
3.0 is in scope; the stages say only what is implemented, and measured against the spec tests, first.

1. **MVP + the 2.0 features** — what toolchains emit by default.
2. **multi-memory** — without it there is no fused WASI 0.2. Part of 3.0.
3. The runtime API and **WASI 0.1**, then **fused WASI 0.2**.
4. **memory64**, **tail calls**, **extended-const**.
5. **exception handling**.
6. **function references** and **GC** — needed by Kotlin, Dart, OCaml, Java-to-wasm; less by C/Rust.
7. **relaxed SIMD**.
8. Outside 3.0: **wide arithmetic**, **threads** (shared memory, atomics), **custom page sizes**.

Tier 3 proposals (branch-hinting, stack-switching, compact-imports) after all of these. Sources and
counters: TESTING.md, "Sources of truth and the completeness counters".

**Staging must not narrow the design.** The 3.0 features change the shapes that every layer shares, and
those are expensive to retrofit: so the front end, the validator and HIR are designed for all of 3.0
from phase 1 even where a target does not implement a feature yet — a memory index on every memory
operation (multi-memory), 64-bit addresses and limits (memory64), the full value-type lattice with
subtyping and reference types (GC, function references), tags and `try_table` as structured control
(exceptions), `return_call*` as terminators (tail calls), multi-value block parameters. A target that
lacks a feature reports it through `Target.supports` and the module runs on another target.

## Exit criteria in numbers

| phase | counters (TESTING.md) |
|---|---|
| 1 | `assert_invalid` / `assert_malformed` of the pinned spec suite pass (the validator) |
| 2 | spec suite for features 1–2 above passes on `pyc` (CPython and PyPy); the rest are listed expected failures |
| 3 | the integer-core spec commands (stage 1, TARGETS.md) pass on `jit-x86_64` exactly as on `pyc`; the backend interface is written down and the PoC's x86-64 code is split into the shared core and the backend; compile time and CoreMark are not worse than the PoC (BENCHMARKS.md) |
| 4 | the same integer-core spec commands pass on the second architecture under QEMU; the size of its backend is recorded; the interface is changed where it leaked x86-64 and then frozen |
| 5 | the same spec commands pass on every JIT target as on `pyc` for the stages it claims; differential fuzzing finds no divergence over an agreed number of hours |
| 6 | the public API is covered by tests of its own plus differential runs against wasmtime (its API used as the oracle, not as a goal); the WASI testsuite (p1) passes; the CLI runs the commands of API.md |
| later | each new proposal enters with its spec tests green on every target that claims it |

## Phase 0 — repository from the PoC
* Package layout of ARCHITECTURE.md; move the PoC's reader, decoder and stack-to-tree builder out of
  `w2py.py` into `frontend/` and `ir/`; the code generators become `targets/pyc` and `targets/jit/x86_64`.
* `pyproject.toml` with **no** runtime dependencies and a development group (wasmtime pinned as the
  oracle, pywasm, pytest; wabt / wasm-tools / meld as external tools).
* CI skeleton: CPython 3.8–latest + PyPy on Linux x86-64.

## Phase 1 — frontend complete
* Full binary reader for every proposal Wasmtime supports (FEATURES.md); the validator (type checking
  of function bodies); constant expressions (extended const).
* Spec-suite harness over the tiny internal engine interface (TESTING.md) running `assert_invalid` / `assert_malformed`.
* HIR (ARCHITECTURE.md, "The IR"): trees, structured control, the analyses (bounds/wrap, local
  weights, effect order, trap points, call graph); documented in code.

## Phase 2 — `pyc` target complete
* All core features of FEATURES.md, SIMD correct before fast; NaN rules settled against the oracle.
* Trap conversion at the boundary; stack-depth counter and `STACK_OVERFLOW`; re-entrancy.
* Long calls: yield points + interrupt word (measure the cost); one-thread-per-store guard.
* Fuel and epochs (compiled in on demand).
* The compilation cache (DECISIONS.md D9); the public `Module.serialize`/`deserialize` and thin/fat
  files (D18) wait for phase 6.
* No embedded runtime: generated code uses the package's runtime (D18); the PoC's emitted `RUNTIME`
  goes away. Regeneration from the wasm on
  any mismatch.
* Exit criterion: the spec suite passes on CPython and PyPy.

## Phase 3 — `jit-x86_64`: integer core and the backend interface
* **Decide the shape of the shared JIT core before writing it** and record it in DECISIONS.md: LIR with
  virtual registers and an allocator (Cranelift style), or one pass over HIR driving a small
  `MacroAssembler`-like backend interface (Winch style; closest to what `w2jit2` already does with its
  lazy value stack, pinned locals and fused compare+branch). Judge by compile time in Python
  (BENCHMARKS.md, "Compile time") as well as by code speed.
* Split `w2jit2` along ARCHITECTURE.md / TARGETS.md: shared core (executable memory, entry and host
  call bridge, value-stack frames, labels and fixups, trap stubs, interrupt and fuel polling, nested
  entries) and the x86-64 backend (encoder, ABI, register pools, instruction selection). Two axes
  stay separate from the start: the ISA and the OS ABI (System V now, Win64 later).
* Stage 1 of TARGETS.md only: i32/i64, locals, globals, control flow, calls, memory with **explicit**
  bounds checks, traps. Guard pages are an optional capability of a backend and come in phase 5.
* Mechanisms every architecture will need are built and tested here, not later: traps unwound by
  returning through frames (CET-safe, RISKS.md R2), re-entrant entry, host exceptions across the
  boundary, interrupt word, stack limits, the executable-memory probe and per-module fallback to `pyc`.
* A backend gets a way to hand an operation it does not implement to a Python helper (a libcall through
  the host-call bridge): slow but correct, so a new architecture runs every module from its first stage.
* The encoder is checked in CI against an external assembler (`llvm-mc` / `objdump`) for every
  instruction form it can emit.

## Phase 4 — the second architecture (integer core) proves the interface
* `jit-aarch64` or `jit-riscv64` (whichever has the cheaper CI; Python for it runs under QEMU user-mode
  in a multi-arch container), integer core only: the same stage 1, the same spec commands as phase 3.
* Record the size of the new backend and what in the shared core or the interface had to change; fix the
  places where x86-64 leaked (flags, two-operand forms, fixed registers for division and shifts) and
  **freeze the interface**. Nothing in phase 5 starts before this.
* After it, decide on copy-and-patch for further architectures with numbers for both approaches.
* aarch64 on macOS (`MAP_JIT` + `pthread_jit_write_protect_np` via ctypes) and Windows on ARM follow
  in phase 5.

## Phase 5 — JIT completion
* The rest of the opcode set in stages (TARGETS.md) on **every** JIT target in step: floats, `call_indirect`
  and tables, `memory.grow` on a reserved range, bulk memory, reference types, multi-value,
  multi-memory, memory64, then SIMD and the later proposals. What a backend lacks goes through a libcall
  until it is written.
* **Guard pages with a JIT-emitted signal handler** (`poc/w2jit_guard.py`: +20–25 % on CoreMark, the gap
  to Cranelift was mostly the bounds checks), per OS and architecture (Linux/BSD `sigaction` +
  `ucontext` offsets, macOS also SIGBUS, Windows a vectored exception handler), `sigaltstack` per thread
  for stack overflow; explicit checks stay the fallback and the default of a new architecture; bounds-check
  elimination where guard pages are not available.
* Trap frames, fuel and epoch checks, the interrupt word polled at back-edges (Ctrl+C via the waiting
  main thread).
* The contract of ARTIFACT.md (format v1, context ABI v1, baseline-ISA sequences, CPU feature
  detection) is **fixed here**, after two architectures have shaped it, together with artifact
  serialization; the C reference loader stays optional (D18).
* Win64 after System V (a second entry trampoline in the same artifact); macOS and Windows on ARM.
* Differential fuzzing against wasmtime (`wasm-smith`) from the first widened stage on.

## Phase 6 — runtime API, WASI, CLI
* `Engine`, `Config`, `Store`, `Module`, `Linker`, `Instance`, externs, `Caller`, `Trap`/`TrapCode`,
  limits, in the shape of wasmtime-py (not a drop-in), over the internal engine interface the spec
  runner has used since phase 1.
* Choose the WASI host (open question 2); WASI 0.1 and fused 0.2 through it (needs multi-memory from
  phase 2).
* `Module.serialize`/`deserialize` and the thin/fat files (D18) on top of the cache of phase 2 and the
  artifacts of phase 5.
* CLI: `run`, `compile`, `wast`, `settings`/`targets`, `cache`.
* Differential tests against wasmtime on real programs.

## Phase 7 — `mpy` target
* `.mpy` ahead of time and on-device source; `@native` where it helps; avoid the `mpy-cross` large
  function bug (LESSONS.md 17).
* Research: lower HIR to `@micropython.viper` code (machine-word ints, `ptr8/16/32` memory) so that
  MicroPython's own emitters become native back ends on every MCU architecture its ports support
  (Thumb, Xtensa, RISC-V, …) without an encoder of ours; inline assemblers (`asm_thumb`, `asm_xtensa`)
  for the hottest functions (TARGETS.md, "MicroPython's own native emitters as JIT back ends").
* Port the translator to run on MicroPython if on-device compilation is wanted.

## Phase 8 — more architectures
* armv7, mips32el (Ingenic X2000), ppc64le, loongarch64 and whichever of aarch64 / riscv64 phase 4 did
  not take — by hand or by copy-and-patch, CI under QEMU user-mode. Each is added by a backend, the
  encoder test and the integer-core spec commands; the shared core does not change.

## Open questions
1. **Minimum Python.** Generated `pyc` code runs on 3.8 (3.4 with `--legacy`); the JIT needs only
   `ctypes` + `mmap` (measured on 3.8 and 3.13). The floor should follow the targets, not the WASI host.
2. **The WASI host.** fusedwasi's Python twin (candidate, not tried with w2py; declares Python 3.10+),
   an own implementation, or another; and what WASI means on MicroPython (open question 6).
3. **Parallelism of `pyc` guests**: yield points only, or also subinterpreters (3.12+/3.14),
   free-threaded builds, a process with shared memory (ARCHITECTURE.md, "Long calls and the GIL")?
4. **Wasmtime options with no meaning here** (`cranelift_*`, `profiler`, `signals_based_traps`, …):
   accept and ignore, or reject?
5. **NaN payloads in `pyc`**: Python floats keep the payload in most paths but not all (f32 rounding
   through `struct`); follow the spec's canonical/arithmetic NaN rules only, or carry bit patterns?
6. **WASI on MicroPython**: a slim twin, or fusedwasi compiled to wasm and translated by w2py itself
   (then each language/target needs only a thin layer of OS primitives)?
7. **Pyodide**: a target calling the browser's `WebAssembly` through `js`, or `pyc` only?
8. **Free-threaded CPython (no GIL)**: shared memories and atomics in `pyc` need real synchronisation.
9. **Name**: `w2py` grew beyond "wasm to Python" — keep it, or rename the runtime and keep `w2py` for
   the translator?
10. **Version skew** — settled by D18: no embedded runtime, exact match or regenerate; fat files carry
   the wasm. Left: the known-bad compiler list (where it lives, how it is updated).
11. **Components on the fly**: accept a component and fuse it at load time (then compile and cache the
   core module by the component's hash) by running **meld compiled to wasm on w2py itself**, shipped
   as a data file in the wheel (Apache-2.0): no native dependency and no second fuser to keep in sync.
   **Checked (meld 0.66.0, BENCHMARKS.md):** meld builds without patches for `wasm32-wasip1` (CLI,
   2.7 MB, 16 WASI p1 imports), `wasm32-wasip2` (component, 2.9 MB) and — best for this use —
   **meld-core alone for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`** behind a ~40-line wrapper (1.7 MB, **no imports at
   all**: `meld_alloc` / `meld_fuse` / `meld_out_ptr` / `meld_out_len`; attestation set to
   `reproducible`, there is no wall clock without WASI). It uses only MVP + sign-ext + `memory.copy` /
   `memory.fill` (no SIMD, no multi-value, no `trunc_sat`), and **the PoC's `pyc` already runs it**:
   meld fusing its own p2 build gives output byte-identical to the same run on wasmtime, in 44 s on
   PyPy and 253 s on CPython (wasmtime 1.05 s) — acceptable once per component with the cache, and the
   JIT will cut it. Still open: its coverage (resources, string transcoding, p3 async). Exports remain
   core functions; Python values need our own canonical-ABI lift at the boundary.
12. **Targets in one Store**: one shared representation of memories, tables and globals with
   per-module fallback, or one target per Store (ARCHITECTURE.md, "State shared across targets")?
   Measure `pyc` on a reserved mapping against a `bytearray` first.
13. **Lazy compilation**: compile each function on its first call (JIT: a stub that compiles and
   patches; `pyc`: translate and `exec` per function) so the first load costs what is used, not the
   whole module (QuickJS: ~1.5 s JIT / ~5.7 s `pyc` for everything; BENCHMARKS.md, "Compile time on
   large modules"). Costs: a patchable call path, compilation in the middle of a call (re-entrancy,
   the GIL, executable-memory growth). Compare with eager compilation + cache before deciding.
