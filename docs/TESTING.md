# Testing

Every target passes the same tests; a target becomes selectable only when it passes them for the
features it claims.

## Sources of truth and the completeness counters

Completeness is measured, not listed by hand: every axis has an upstream document that says what
"complete" is and an upstream test suite that turns it into a number. CI reports all the numbers; the
exit criterion of each phase (ROADMAP.md) is a value of them.

| axis | what defines it | what measures it | counter |
|---|---|---|---|
| wasm semantics | **WebAssembly Core Specification 3.0** (W3C, 2025: GC, memory64, exceptions, tail calls, multi-memory, relaxed SIMD, typed function references, extended const are part of it); the proposal repositories for what is not in 3.0 (wide-arithmetic, custom-page-sizes, threads) | `WebAssembly/spec` `test/core` at a pinned commit, the proposal repos' tests, Wasmtime's own `tests/misc_testsuite` (Wasmtime-specific behaviour) | spec commands passed, per target and per proposal |
| which features, in which order | Wasmtime's "Wasm Proposals" page (stability tiers): Tier 1 (on by default) is the required set — 17 proposals, 16 without the component model; Tier 2: custom-page-sizes, threads; Tier 3 (branch-hinting, stack-switching, compact-imports) later | the per-target expected-failures files | proposals complete, per target |
| Python API | **wasmtime-py** at the pinned version: its public classes and **its own test suite** (`tests/`) | wasmtime-py's tests run against w2py through a shim (`import w2py as wasmtime`), plus an API-surface test that diffs `dir()` of every public class against wasmtime-py's | wasmtime-py tests passed; missing names |
| CLI | the `wasmtime` binary at the pinned version: `run`, `compile`, `wast`, `settings`, the option groups `-W` (wasm features), `-S` (WASI), `-O`, `-D` | the option list scraped from `wasmtime --help` / `run --help` of the pinned version, not copied by hand | options accepted (or deliberately refused, DECISIONS.md) |
| WASI | p1: `wasi_snapshot_preview1.witx` (`WebAssembly/WASI`, legacy/preview1); p2: the WIT packages `wasi:cli`, `wasi:io`, `wasi:filesystem`, `wasi:clocks`, `wasi:random`, `wasi:sockets`, `wasi:http` | `WebAssembly/wasi-testsuite` (p1 at least; check its p2 coverage), the chosen host's own conformance tests | WASI tests passed |
| everything the suites miss | Wasmtime's behaviour wherever the spec leaves room (NaN, trap codes, stack limits) | differential fuzzing: `wasm-tools smith` modules run on every target and on wasmtime | fuzz hours without a divergence |

When the pinned wasmtime / wasmtime-py version moves, the API-surface diff and the scraped CLI options
show what is new; the spec commit moves the same way, in small steps.

`FEATURES.md` becomes generated from the expected-failures files (feature × target), not hand-written.

## Development dependencies (never runtime)

| tool | why |
|---|---|
| **wasmtime** (pip, pinned) | **the test oracle**: differential runs compare every w2py target with Wasmtime on the same module and inputs (results, traps, memory contents); also the reference for API behaviour and feature defaults |
| wabt (`wast2json`, `wasm2wat`) | turns the spec test suite `.wast` files into `.json` + `.wasm` (natify-sh/wabt-package, or built from source as in the PoC) |
| wasm-tools (`wasm-smith`, `validate`) | random valid modules for differential fuzzing; a second validator |
| pywasm (pip) | a second oracle and a source of ideas: its spec runner (`test/spec.py`) was adapted in the PoC session; it passes the core spec suite (54 006 commands, 0 failures at its pinned spec commit `fffc6e12f`) but treats `assert_invalid` / `assert_malformed` as no-ops |
| meld | fusing component test programs into core modules for WASI 0.2 |
| MicroPython unix port, `mpy-cross` | the `mpy` target |
| QEMU user-mode | JIT targets for other architectures in CI |

The runtime package itself declares **no** dependencies; these live in a development group.
The Python ones are the uv `dev` group in `pyproject.toml` (`uv sync`); wasmtime 50.0.1 needs
Python ≥ 3.9 and `wabt-package` ≥ 3.11, so tests that need the oracle or `wast2json` skip where they
are absent (the CPython 3.8 job runs the rest).

## The spec test suite

* Source: `WebAssembly/spec` `test/core` (+ `simd/`, and the proposal repositories for features not
  merged yet), converted with `wast2json`. Pin the commit; move it in small steps.
* One harness, many targets: the JSON commands (`module`, `register`, `assert_return`,
  `assert_trap`, `assert_exhaustion`, `assert_invalid`, `assert_malformed`, `assert_unlinkable`,
  `assert_uninstantiable`, `action`) are executed through the **public w2py API**, parametrised over
  targets (`pytest -k target`). Unlike pywasm, `assert_invalid` / `assert_malformed` are real tests
  of our validator.
* Expected failures are listed per target in a file in the repo (feature not implemented yet), so
  progress is visible and regressions fail.

## Differential testing

* For each module (spec modules, `wasm-smith` output, real programs): run every target and Wasmtime;
  compare return values, trap codes, final memory hash, globals.
* NaN results compare by the spec's rules (canonical / arithmetic NaN), not bit-for-bit.
* A mismatch is minimized (`wasm-tools shrink`) and kept as a regression test.

## Programs and benchmarks

* CoreMark (`poc/in/core.wasm`, `zig cc -O3`): correctness by its own CRC self-check, speed in it/s.
  Record new numbers in BENCHMARKS.md with the conditions.
* WASI: the WASI testsuite (p1), the chosen host's conformance tests (fusedwasi has them for p2),
  small programs in C, Rust, Zig.
* Long calls: a guest loop interrupted from another thread and by SIGINT (CLI) on every target; another
  Python thread's progress during a long call.
* A few larger real modules (e.g. a compression library, a Python-in-wasm build, the ballistics core
  compiled to wasm) for compile time, cache behaviour and speed.

## CI matrix

| axis | values |
|---|---|
| Python | CPython 3.8 (or the chosen floor), 3.10, 3.12, 3.13, latest; PyPy 3.10+; free-threaded build later |
| OS | Linux x86-64, Linux aarch64, macOS arm64 (MAP_JIT), Windows x86-64 |
| target | `pyc` everywhere; `jit-*` where the machine matches; `mpy` with the MicroPython unix port |
| emulated | QEMU user-mode for riscv64, armv7, mips32el as JIT targets appear |

JIT artifacts: run baseline artifacts on an emulated baseline CPU (e.g. QEMU `-cpu` without SSE4.1 /
with plain ARMv8.0) and check that a higher-level artifact is refused there; load artifacts with the C
reference loader as well as from Python; refuse artifacts with an unknown format or context ABI version.

Run with executable memory forbidden too (e.g. a seccomp/SELinux profile or a forced probe failure) to
prove the fallback to `pyc`.
